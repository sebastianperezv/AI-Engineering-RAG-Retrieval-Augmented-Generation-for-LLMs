It is visible he carries a lot of bad practices from R, doesn\\'t know PEP8, and doesn\\'t have advanced programming skills (he repeats a lot of code instead of using functions or classes). 2. He\\'s not a very good ML practitioner, either. His models have poor performance (the best forecasting model has +30% MAPE... and he chose that example data...), and he doesn\\'t know very well how to address the poor performance. Most of the times he just acts like there\\'s nothing to be done. For example, his Prophet+XGBoost model performs worse than the Prophet model by itself, and this is not addressed in the lesson.

The visuals are great, and your Python coding is fun and approachable. However, at moments I caught myself being a bit frustrated because the theoretical and statistical underpinning of the course is very limited. So to be able to properly understand these models I was forced to constantly switch between your course and university textbooks in econometrics and time series, even though I took intro stats and econometrics in college. Given that I need this for work and I believe other students need that too, it is difficult to intuitively apply methods in the real-world setting while equipped with a rudimentary grasp of statistics behind them. I think intuition is built in part through studying theory. So to make this a one-stop-shop, the course would greatly benefit from at least some math and stats to describe the concepts behind the models. I understand you refrained from that approach as you probably wanted to open this topic to non-math professionals, and that makes sense to a degree, but I think you ought to make more effort toward striking the right balance between theory and practice. Of course, this is my personal view, based on my background and needs, and I am sure that other folks with different objectives and backgrounds can get a lot of value from the course.

I also like how the courses was broken-down into many bit-size short videos which we can follow easily step-by-step. \\\\nPerhaps if we can have consistent case study intuition (explanation) and R tutorial example. Using different example for each models make the course contents look more like project / coding showcase instead of a structured course. \\\\nOther things that might be improved would be using train-test/validate approach to compare AUC/ Sensitivity or MAE/MAPE instead of predict everything then compare with everything in original dataset. \\\\nOverall, it is very useful content and it definitely improve my knowledge.

Loved how Diogo still answers questions even after a year of the publishing of this course.</td></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Ana Clara GonÃ§alves</td><td>2022-10-20 11:45:59+00:00</td><td>4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders</td><td>Atunbi Adeyinka Temitope</td><td>2022-10-20 10:14:12+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td>YES IT WAS A GOOD MATCH FOR ME</td></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Turgut Guliyev</td><td>2022-10-20 06:05:11+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders</td><td>OH CHIN KIONG</td><td>2022-10-20 05:07:58+00:00</td><td>4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders</td><td>Asad Hanif Khan</td><td>2022-10-19 15:36:42+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Anonymized User</td><td>2022-10-19 15:06:12+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Fengying Deng</td><td>2022-10-18 22:30:26+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Juan David Perdomo Quiroz</td><td>2022-10-18 22:02:59+00:00</td><td>3.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Shehzad Aslam</td><td>2022-10-18 21:31:15+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders</td><td>Samuel Kamau</td><td>2022-10-18 21:01:12+00:00</td><td>5</td><td>Very interactive and the images reinforce the information</td></tr><tr><td>Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders</td><td>Nguyen Van Loc ã…¤</td><td>2022-10-18 12:46:19+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Miguel A.

The pacing was good and the code was easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic, but in my opinion, there could be some improvements.\\\\n\\\\n1) At the end of every section, before the exercise, the models are evaluated on the same data set, while the results vary, they are not great. It would be much more helpful if there was some sort of revision or tweaks made to the model to see how it could be improved rather than just saying \"it looks better\" or \"it is not so great\". For example, the Prophet + XGBoost results were worse than the regular Prophet results, but no explanation or discussion was made about it.

I will for sure check out your other courses and recommend it to anyone who is intrested in forecasting!</td></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Eric Hollis</td><td>2021-11-06 21:36:28+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>BQ DESY HARDIANTI</td><td>2021-11-06 09:32:37+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Pamela Huerta Islas</td><td>2021-11-04 23:58:03+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Rodrigo Vallejo Rafful</td><td>2021-11-04 22:38:33+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Robert A Moritz</td><td>2021-11-03 18:55:06+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python &amp; R</td><td>Andrew Symonds</td><td>2021-10-30 21:45:58+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Almaamon Rasool Abdali Hussain</td><td>2021-10-29 19:19:51+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Hristiyan Yordanov</td><td>2021-10-29 04:12:38+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Juan Vizcaino</td><td>2021-10-28 22:52:19+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>T Guo</td><td>2021-10-24 21:59:37+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Anonymized User</td><td>2021-10-24 20:59:59+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python &amp; R</td><td>Jaroslav Kotrba</td><td>2021-10-22 14:03:10+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Mannat Soni</td><td>2021-10-17 14:01:10+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Myroslava Astion</td><td>2021-10-16 13:03:18+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Gil Barreto de GÃ³es</td><td>2021-10-14 19:25:24+00:00</td><td>3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Ujwal Sapkota</td><td>2021-10-14 12:53:50+00:00</td><td>4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Janine Zitianellis</td><td>2021-10-13 03:00:02+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Ioana Pasa</td><td>2021-10-11 11:48:57+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Antonina Kliuieva</td><td>2021-10-10 16:36:50+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python &amp; R</td><td>Anonymized User</td><td>2021-10-10 14:39:49+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Michael Burkhart</td><td>2021-10-10 11:06:45+00:00</td><td>5</td><td>A fantastic introduction to the concepts.

It has a good diversity of content and the theory is well explained.\\\\nIn a few points I thing the course could be improved:\\\\n- I find that the definition of multiplicative and additive seasonality is a bit unclear. The advise seems to find it out by trial and error and define your choice depending on the final model output, if I got it right. Well, I wish to be possible to find out about the type of seasonality before running the model.\\\\n- All that copy-paste procedure causes some disorientation. I suggest you use a script template only for the part of loading and pre-processing the data, and the exporting part in the end. It is good practice to re-write the code of the rest of the script (i.e. the modelling and model training part). I think it helps with learning, and after all, they are just 5 models. \\\\n- In the exercise statement of Neural Networks, when you ask for forecasting 4 periods, I thought you where talking about the period of a cycle (i.e. the season). So I have forecasted 16 quarters, since each cyclic period have 4 quarters. oss. to measure the period I\\'ve decomposed the time series and looked at the seasonal pattern.\\\\nThanks for the course.</td></tr><tr><td>Data Mining for Business Analytics &amp; Data Analysis in Python</td><td>Kearabetswe Molaoa Tilo</td><td>2021-07-27 06:55:03+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Cameron Belt</td><td>2021-07-27 05:22:07+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python &amp; R</td><td>Ajay Rengunthwar</td><td>2021-07-27 03:06:54+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Phoebe</td><td>2021-07-24 05:43:50+00:00</td><td>5</td><td>Very useful for forecasting, especially with regressors.

To use famous papers as examples is a great idea. Still, much to be improved. Things are still missing, namely in depth summaries for students not used to econometrics, restrictions on how one should use each model for and when they shouldn\\'t. I would also end every section with an in depth view of the output of the model and the interpretation / operational or public policy conclusions that the decision maker should make - Something easy when using economics papers as guidelines. And I wouldn\\'t do it directly from the Spyder screen, but on PPT, like the intro sections. Would recommend the professor to see the 365 course on Credit models, to see how he can explain both model characteristics, limitations and outputs easily without hurting the flow. \\\\n\\\\nWould support a second course on intermediate/advanced Econometrics on Python. There is barely any courses for trained economists coming from R or Stata who need to use Python, but I do believe the professor is able to increase the depth by adding new models, examples and case studies in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Holly Houliston</td><td>2021-06-01 16:59:39+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Narayan Tech</td><td>2021-05-31 08:01:41+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Python for Data Analysis and Business Analytics 2024</td><td>Carlos AndrÃ©s Campo GonzÃ¡lez</td><td>2021-05-30 20:02:16+00:00</td><td>3.5</td><td>Step by step introductory course on the basics of linear regression using Python, but I really wished it would go deeper or with more examples than the mere basics - specially for people already used to Linear Regression models in other tools.</td></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Brial Munetsi</td><td>2021-05-29 23:29:57+00:00</td><td>4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python &amp; R</td><td/><td>2021-05-29 20:46:29+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Ali Denewade</td><td>2021-05-29 16:19:01+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Laurent Vaute</td><td>2021-05-28 08:36:05+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Carlos Osiris Laborin Diaz</td><td>2021-05-27 22:02:13+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Mining for Business Analytics &amp; Data Analysis in Python</td><td>Vik Sor</td><td>2021-05-27 15:09:32+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Arjun Kaarat</td><td>2021-05-26 16:00:31+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Data Mining for Business Analytics &amp; Data Analysis in Python</td><td>Nensi Kopellaj</td><td>2021-05-26 09:59:51+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Jakub KleÄ_x008d_ka</td><td>2021-05-26 07:50:18+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Koushik Suresh</td><td>2021-05-26 07:13:07+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024</td><td>Dr</td><td>2021-05-26 06:47:20+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Nqaba Samkelo Duma</td><td>2021-05-25 23:56:55+00:00</td><td>5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Forecasting Models &amp; Time Series Analysis for Business in R</td><td>Roberson Ribeiro Pontes</td><td>2021-05-25 18:10:58+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R &amp; Python</td><td>Fernando Zambrano</td><td>2021-05-25 04:04:50+00:00</td><td>4.5</td><td>Made it very easy to follow and was direct to the point.

Diogo\\'s \"Business Data Analytics & Intelligence With Python\" course before, and I like the concise and the hands-on approach.\\\\nSuggestions: \\\\n1) Elaborate more on the library parameters and the intuition behind the model.\\\\n2) To list the dependencies for local development and for deployment.

Continuous variables are usually defined as variables which can take an infinite number of values within a specific range. Each value can be infinitesimally small. Discrete variables can only take integer or natural number values. So number of people is a discrete variable, because you can\\'t have a small fraction of a person.\\\\n2. It\\'s not clear why standard deviation was needed in the case study, because the actual values and delta in revenues, profit, etc. could easily be calculated.

The instructor\\'s engaging teaching style, coupled with diverse resources like interactive lectures and practical assignments, made the learning experience enjoyable. However, clearer communication regarding assignment deadlines could enhance the experience. The availability of supplementary materials was beneficial for deeper understanding. Overall, while there are areas for improvement, the course offered valuable insights and knowledge that I would recommend to others seeking a solid foundation in this field.

He\\'s not a very good Python programmer. It is visible he carries a lot of bad practices from R, doesn\\'t know PEP8, and doesn\\'t have advanced programming skills (he repeats a lot of code instead of using functions or classes). 2. He\\'s not a very good ML practitioner, either. His models have poor performance (the best forecasting model has +30% MAPE... and he chose that example data...), and he doesn\\'t know very well how to address the poor performance. Most of the times he just acts like there\\'s nothing to be done. For example, his Prophet+XGBoost model performs worse than the Prophet model by itself, and this is not addressed in the lesson. Why?

Considered this course as a audio version of those.\\\\n3- instructor doesn\\'t really know python and code could easily be improved\\\\n4- exercices don\\'t add anything to learning. It\\'s just an opportunity to writte the exact same code you wrote in the theoric part.\\\\n5- course info say it\\'s about 15 hours but the course is slowed down (must go to 1.5x speed to have a normal speaking person)\\\\n6- video are overly cut to make increase the number of videos but most of them are about 1 min long\\\\n\\\\nIf I know that there was not other link with Zero To Mastery but the name, I\\'d never bought this course.

Not too deep that you get lost in the minutiae, but still gives you a good context of where the ideas come from. That said, it\\'s not a course for absolute beginners in Python and data science. To enjoy the benefits of the course and not get stuck on the technical aspects of it, better have a good grasp of Pandas/numpy/ML basics.

Nonetheless i learned a lot from the core parts so thank you for the ZTM team and Diogo for their efforts.

The visuals are great, and your Python coding is fun and approachable. However, at moments I caught myself being a bit frustrated because the theoretical and statistical underpinning of the course is very limited. So to be able to properly understand these models I was forced to constantly switch between your course and university textbooks in econometrics and time series, even though I took intro stats and econometrics in college. Given that I need this for work and I believe other students need that too, it is difficult to intuitively apply methods in the real-world setting while equipped with a rudimentary grasp of statistics behind them. I think intuition is built in part through studying theory. So to make this a one-stop-shop, the course would greatly benefit from at least some math and stats to describe the concepts behind the models. I understand you refrained from that approach as you probably wanted to open this topic to non-math professionals, and that makes sense to a degree, but I think you ought to make more effort toward striking the right balance between theory and practice. Of course, this is my personal view, based on my background and needs, and I am sure that other folks with different objectives and backgrounds can get a lot of value from the course. I would still recommend the course to everyone. Descent job Diego, keep it up!

Also, up to now NON of the regression problems have done a good job, so you cant really asses how good a method is. \\\\nIf you are looking for a very basic course without mayor information about why things happen this might work for you.

Each learning unit built a python model that you can use in your job as a data analyst. The challenges were rigorous but they were relevant and applicable to the business use case that you get on the job. And the best part about the course was that the instructor was always there to help you code - by patiently going over and explaining the code - line by line. I highly recommend the course. Data Literacy and Business Analytics for Business Leaders Michael Nagle 2023-07-05 17:38:47+00:00 3.5 This course is valuable but also very drawn out which makes focusing on some of the heavier content a challenge. Fitting it in around other workflow is nearly impossible.

Master Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python 2024 Luqman Rumaiz 2023-06-08 09:06:44+00:00 5 Instructor Diogo was able to break it down in a way that a beginner can understand, despite time series forecasting is a normally challenging ML concept. He has good communication skills and always made sure to go as far as explaining each parameter.\\\\n\\\\nHis Discord server is also really useful as you can clarify any doubts you have on time series forecasting, and he has helped me a ton. Would really recommend you to grab this course as it is still, considering that Diogo also looks out to update it with new sections for recent techniques in TS forecasting.

Kincaid 2023-06-08 01:46:34+00:00 5 I was looking for more explanation about what econometrics is and the math behind it. For instance, when the instructor says that a given number means that something is a good match, I don\\'t understand why (other than p-values). The course has taught me R Studio, which is something I wanted to learn so it was certainly worth my time. But, it didn\\'t teach what I was looking for this class.

I have no doubt that under the ZTM every course is as professional and well made as it could be! Although I have to admit that some concepts seem very advanced to me and I have to look for additional explanations on youtube or elsewhere on the internet to better understand them. I have no prior experience in statistics. Ideally, if the course had animated sections with extremely clear visualization of the concepts, it usually work for me to understand abstract concepts better.

It is very unique from others stat/data science course which focusing more on econometrics model. I also like how the courses was broken-down into many bit-size short videos which we can follow easily step-by-step. \\\\nPerhaps if we can have consistent case study intuition (explanation) and R tutorial example. Using different example for each models make the course contents look more like project / coding showcase instead of a structured course. \\\\nOther things that might be improved would be using train-test/validate approach to compare AUC/ Sensitivity or MAE/MAPE instead of predict everything then compare with everything in original dataset. \\\\nOverall, it is very useful content and it definitely improve my knowledge. Thanks.

I came from Andrei\\'s Complete Python 2022 course, and it looks as though his Data Science and Machine Learning chapters at the end will dovetail nicely with this new course. I firmly believe ZTM has improved in suggesting courses that are not only integral to my interests but also logical next steps along my learning path.

I understand the templates as well and they will be very helpful. I would\\'ve liked to learn as well how to do Forecast models for different SKUs (different y variables) with the same code sheet, because many people work on doing many different product forecasts. Also, I would\\'ve liked to know if the models work with missing data, with zeros, with some days (eg. sundays) having 0 sales, etc. In general, I liked it very much and learned a lot! Loved how Diogo still answers questions even after a year of the publishing of this course.

The pacing was good and the code was easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone interested in this topic, but in my opinion, there could be some improvements.\\\\n\\\\n1) At the end of every section, before the exercise, the models are evaluated on the same data set, while the results vary, they are not great. It would be much more helpful if there was some sort of revision or tweaks made to the model to see how it could be improved rather than just saying \"it looks better\" or \"it is not so great\". For example, the Prophet + XGBoost results were worse than the regular Prophet results, but no explanation or discussion was made about it. Felt incomplete.\\\\n2) There is a lot of wasted time opening and copying/pasting the same scripts over and over again for every kind of model.

You code beside the tutor and in addition the code is well structured and delivered for your fast personal use.\\\\n\\\\nSome constructive comments would be that the course should use bad/dirty data as in a real life case scenario, so we could learn how to clean it in a more detailed way.\\\\n\\\\nHowever as in my case, if you have any questions, the tutor himself makes a great job at answering them and even goes a little further and delivers an example of his answer. \\\\n\\\\nGreat course and would totally recommend!

I also got confused with some of the scripting, would have preferred to have the script at the beginning of each section so we can code along. Thank you.

It has a good diversity of content and the theory is well explained.\\\\nIn a few points I thing the course could be improved:\\\\n- I find that the definition of multiplicative and additive seasonality is a bit unclear. The advise seems to find it out by trial and error and define your choice depending on the final model output, if I got it right. Well, I wish to be possible to find out about the type of seasonality before running the model.\\\\n- All that copy-paste procedure causes some disorientation. I suggest you use a script template only for the part of loading and pre-processing the data, and the exporting part in the end. It is good practice to re-write the code of the rest of the script (i.e. the modelling and model training part). I think it helps with learning, and after all, they are just 5 models. \\\\n- In the exercise statement of Neural Networks, when you ask for forecasting 4 periods, I thought you where talking about the period of a cycle (i.e. the season). So I have forecasted 16 quarters, since each cyclic period have 4 quarters. oss. to measure the period I\\'ve decomposed the time series and looked at the seasonal pattern.\\\\nThanks for the course.

Easy to follow and highly recommended for anyone interested in the topic Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python Carlos AndrÃ©s Campo GonzÃ¡lez 2021-06-02 13:51:45+00:00 4 Much better course than the regression for business one. To use famous papers as examples is a great idea. Still, much to be improved. Things are still missing, namely in depth summaries for students not used to econometrics, restrictions on how one should use each model for and when they shouldn\\'t. I would also end every section with an in depth view of the output of the model and the interpretation / operational or public policy conclusions that the decision maker should make - Something easy when using economics papers as guidelines. And I wouldn\\'t do it directly from the Spyder screen, but on PPT, like the intro sections. Would recommend the professor to see the 365 course on Credit models, to see how he can explain both model characteristics, limitations and outputs easily without hurting the flow. \\\\n\\\\nWould support a second course on intermediate/advanced Econometrics on Python. There is barely any courses for trained economists coming from R or Stata who need to use Python, but I do believe the professor is able to increase the depth by adding new models, examples and case studies in the future.

Main positive points: 1 â€“ Videos / expositions are all very much to the point, clear and short (<= 10 min, not of the tiring 45 min â€“ 1 hour sort); 2 â€“ Thorough presentation of the applicable R code (in one instance it didnâ€™t work for me and I wrote Diogo about it â€“ his reply, which solved the problem, came back almost immediately, and it was on a Saturday!); 3 â€“ Extremely practical, providing enough theory/background to understand and apply the method (Holt-Winters up to now) without going into lengthy abstruse discussions and showing how R can automatically handle issues so as to avoid tiresome and error-prone coding. No negative points of any relevance. I certainly look forward to the second half of the course confident it will be very instructive and useful. Very good job, Diogo! â€“ Vernon Kohl, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil Forecasting Models & Time Series Analysis for Business in R Louis Mehr 2020-12-18 20:44:57+00:00 5 Diogo is a top instructor.

XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R Christian Zeller 2020-11-01 19:02:37+00:00 5 This course is really great!\\\\nI was looking for a course that gives me deeper understanding in logistic regression based ML models. Unfortunately most of the courses on machine learning try to explain all models but rather on a high level. This course shows how to solve a problem end-to-end by going through the algorythm and some optimization iterations step by step.\\\\nCross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning are also two important parts of this course that made it so valuable for me.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe tow points for improvement: Some important topics such as evaluation metrics, when to choose which one and how to optimize the model for the chosen one would make the course even more valuable. Also I would be very interested in understanding when it is time to retrain the model and whether you would then apply again hyperparameter tuning or not.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all: Great course that allows quick progress for beginners like me. Master Python for Data Analysis and Business Analytics 2024 Moaz alhomsi 2020-10-31 19:40:44+00:00 5 Diogo thank you again for such a knowledge. i needed a refresh for linear regression with python and yet started by R.

Totally worth the money. The concepts are very well explained and the implementation of causal inference techniques covered in this course is really tough to find elsewhere on the internet. Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python Louis Mehr 2020-10-19 21:44:21+00:00 5 I have not seen another course like this. The focus is on solving problems, not the underlying mathematics. Dogio talks through the details in small steps from concept to working code. He covers a lot of ground but you can always use the code to drill down further. This course is worth it for the CausalImpact example alone but it covers much more than just that. Covering both R and Python is a good bonus too. I am looking forward to more courses like this.

Beautiful content, real examples, and amazing feedback whenever I had questions! I especially loved the set up of putting each area into context with real life examples, then discussing the model process, then doing the coding. Very nice to follow! Each video was short and sweet - perfect for doing a bit here and there, without feeling daunting that you need to commit to spending an hour on the course at a time! Following the coding was very straightforward and easy, I really appreciated the repetition of \"this is how you install a package\" because it really reinforced my learning, and was always something I\\'d forget. \\\\nThe only things I feel could be improved, and I\\'m being very picky here, were the speed of some of the videos (although you can \\'speed\\' them up!), and perhaps adding a bit more customisation to the output visualisations Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python Joseph Ujwal Kovuri 2020-10-07 04:00:57+00:00 4.5 XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R Myriam BÃ¼rkli 2020-10-05 11:52:49+00:00 5 Amazing course - nice step by step guide for xgboost, not too much mathematical explanation, just the ones you need and easily explained.

As a data analyst that is slowly getting into the world of ML I really needed an introductory course and this did the job perfectly. Diogo is well structured and the course is very easy to follow and most importantly the practical part is something that is applicable to what I am currently working on and what my professional development will be.

Usage of sources of free online data would be much better (like the stocks library). And it might worth considering giving exercise to be solved alone (with solutions).\\\\nFinally, I believe that the assumptions in the heart of the techniques should be stressed more, perhaps with an example of why the analysis is wrong if the assumption fails. Repeating some of the theoretical statements during the coding can help too.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for everything! XGBoost for Business: Machine Learning Course in Python & R Joao Costa 2020-07-05 15:25:48+00:00 5 Great walkthrough of XGBoost in Python. Econometrics and Statistics for Business in R & Python Moaz alhomsi 2020-06-27 05:09:22+00:00 5 This course is simply the best econometrics course out there. Diogo knows what he is doing, real life case studies, no nonsense theories and complications. I highly recommend this course.\\\\nBut including some math could\\'ve been great, maybe adding some formulas as papers in the next update will be GREAT.
