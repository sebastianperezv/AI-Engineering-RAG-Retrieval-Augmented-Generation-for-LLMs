## üéØ Main Goals

The primary objectives of this project/curriculum are to transition from basic LLM usage to building powerful, enterprise-ready AI systems:

* **Combine Generative AI** with RAG to build smarter, factual, and less "hallucinatory" AI systems.
* Master **FAISS** for fast, efficient similarity searches in massive vector datasets.
* Utilize **OpenAI APIs** for advanced text generation, embeddings, and processing unstructured data.
* Apply **Prompt Engineering** techniques to achieve optimal, reliable AI responses.
* Build practical, real-world applications, including **chatbots** and **financial analysis tools**.
* Explore advanced, frontier concepts like **Multimodal** and **Agentic RAG**.

## üìö Course Breakdown and Modules

This repository is structured around eight foundational modules, progressing from core retrieval concepts to advanced agentic systems:

### 1. Basics of Retrieval Systems
Foundation for efficient searching and retrieval. Covers text preparation, retrieval models (Boolean, vector space), indexing, querying, and ranking relevant information in massive datasets.

### 2. Basics of Generation Models
Introduces the principles of text generation. Focuses on the **Transformer architecture**, **attention mechanisms**, and fundamental data preparation techniques for LLMs.

### 3. Introduction to RAG
The core module explaining how RAG combines retrieval and generation models to create accurate, contextually relevant, and comprehensive responses. Understanding the basic RAG architecture.

### 4. Working With The OpenAI API
Practical skills for accessing and utilizing powerful OpenAI models. Covers API keys, environment setup, crafting effective prompts, parameter tuning, and the influence of the system prompt.

### 5. RAG with OpenAI Implementation
Hands-on section on building fully functional RAG systems. Integration of retrieval and generation components using the OpenAI API to handle complex tasks.

### 6. Working with Unstructured Data
Techniques for processing and extracting information from various formats like **PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, EPUBs, images, and Excel data**.

### 7. Multimodal RAG
Extending RAG to handle data from **multiple modalities** (e.g., text and images). Building systems that integrate different data types for richer, contextually relevant responses.

### 8. Agentic RAG
The cutting edge of RAG development. Focuses on building autonomous **AI agents** that can interact, handle tasks, make decisions, and dynamically respond to complex user requests using state management and workflows.
